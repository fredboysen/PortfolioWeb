              <h3>Application for Solar Energy Management and Investment Assesment</h3>
              <p> Creating a database and solar panel monitoring system/application which aim was to easily monitor the 
                input for any errors of each panel, output and efficiency of the solar panels. The application was created 
                to store these data into a database where the user could monitor the output throughout a specific time 
                period. During the project I also helped develop an investment plan of solar panels which would cover 
                the potential efficiency, savings and costs for the company</p>

                <h3>Market Research Calculator</h3>
                <p> During the third semester project, I had the responsibility of creating an application which could give the
                    user a quick and easy overview of a selected country’s score based on relevant factors in market 
                    attractiveness and the company’s own competitive strengths. This application was used in order to establish a business plan for a company which we worked 
                    with through the project which goal was to emerge into new markets possibilities primarily the US, Japan 
                    and China</p>
